        "abstract": "Over recent decades, in vitro and in vivo models have significantly advanced brain cancer research; however, each presents distinct challenges for accurately mimicking in situ conditions. In response, organotypic slice cultures have emerged as a promising model recapitulating precisely specific in vivo phenotypes through an ex vivo approach. Ex vivo organotypic brain slice models can integrate biological relevance and patient-specific variability early in drug discovery, thereby aiming for more precise treatment stratification. However, the challenges of obtaining representative fresh brain tissue, ensuring reproducibility, and maintaining essential central nervous system (CNS)-specific conditions reflecting the in situ situation over time have limited the direct application of ex vivo organotypic slice cultures in robust clinical trials. In this review, we explore the benefits and possible limitations of ex vivo organotypic brain slice cultures in neuro-oncological research. Additionally, we share insights from clinical experts in neuro-oncology on how to overcome these current limitations and improve the practical application of organotypic brain slice cultures beyond academic research.",

Reports and preclinical data have suggested that tumor cells with specific rearrangements such as RAF1 gene fusions could be therapeutically targeted. To investigate the relevance of targeted therapy in patients with melanoma harboring RAF1 gene fusions, we reviewed records of 1268 melanoma patients with targeted sequencing data at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. We identified 9 cases and report here on their clinicopathologic characteristics. We describe the favorable outcome of 2 patients who received MEK inhibitor therapy, including 1 patient with a durable response. We coalesced our data with published reports of patients with RAF1 gene fusions who were treated with targeted therapy. We find that single-agent MEK inhibition has anti-tumor activity in melanoma patients harboring an RAF1 gene fusion, and we propose that patients with RAF1 gene fusions should be considered for single-agent MEK inhibitor therapy.",

        "authors": "Rick van der Geest, Janet S Lee",
        "abstract": "Basic leucine zipper transcription factor ATF-like 2 (BATF2) is a transcription factor that is known to exhibit tumor-suppressive activity in cancer cells. Within recent years, however, BATF2 has also emerged as an important transcriptional regulator of the immune system. Through its immunomodulatory function, BATF2 has been implicated in a variety of (patho)physiological processes, including host defense against infection, anti-tumor immunity, and maintenance of tissue inflammatory homeostasis. Below, we discuss recent literature that has provided insight into the role of BATF2 as a transcriptional regulator of immune responses in health and disease, including the cell types that express BATF2, the different diseases in which the immunomodulatory effects of BATF2 have been shown to play a role, and the molecular mechanisms through which BATF2 is thought to exert those effects. In doing so, we highlight that the immunological effects of BATF2 are highly context-dependent, and we point out overlap between the mechanisms of action of BATF2 in infectious disease and non-infectious disease. We also discuss areas of interest for future research, the clinical relevance of better understanding BATF2 function, and potential strategies for therapeutic modulation of BATF2.",

        "authors": "Eric Kostka, Yohann Le Govic, Céline Damiani, Anne Totet",
        "abstract": "(1,3)-β-D-Glucan (BG) assay is a non-invasive test commonly used in the diagnostic of invasive fungal diseases. Given its high sensitivity, it was suggested that a negative BG result is sufficient for exluding the diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). However, suboptimal performance has been described in HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus)-negative patients, particularly those with haematological malignancies. We aimed to assess the sensitivity of the BG assay for diagnosing PCP in HIV-negative patients based on their underlying PCP risk factors. We conducted a single-center, retrospective study (2009-2021) enrolling HIV-negative patients diagnosed with PCP and who underwent BG testing. Patients colonized with Pneumocystis jirovecii were included as a control group. In all, 55 PCP patients and 61 colonized patients met the inclusion criteria. Patients were further categorized according to their underlying condition exposing to PCP. Median BG concentration was significantly higher in the PCP group than in the colonization group (500 vs. 31 pg/ml; p < 10-4, Mann-Whitney test) and the BG assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 82% for PCP diagnosis. Notably, sensitivity was significantly higher in non-cancer patients (100%) compared to those with solid cancer (72%) and haematologic cancer (79%) (p < 0.05, Fischer's exact test). These findings strengthen the high performance of BG testing for screening PCP in non-cancer patients, comparable to that observed in HIV-infected individuals. In contrast, they highlight its low reliability in patients with malignancies, emphasizing the importance of considering underlying conditions when interpreting BG results and refining the role of the test in PCP diagnosis.",
